# Blood Glucose Data Import Guide

This repository contains a step-by-step guide on how to import blood glucose data from sensor cloud services into Apple Health using Apple's built-in Shortcuts application. While this guide was originally created for the Libre Freestyle 2 sensor, the approach is adaptable to any glucose sensor that provides measurement datetime and value data.

## Overview

The process involves three main steps:

1. Downloading data from the sensor's cloud service (e.g., LibreView website)
2. Formatting and preparing the data using Google Sheets
3. Using an Apple Shortcuts script to import the data into Apple Health

## Detailed Steps

### 1. Downloading Data from LibreView



### 2. Formatting Data


### 3. Using Apple Shortcuts


## Additional Information

- This method can be adapted for use with other glucose sensors, as long as you can obtain the measurement datetime and glucose value.
